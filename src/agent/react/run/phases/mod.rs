//! Phase functions for `AgentRunSnapshot::run_core_loop`.
//!
//! `run_core_loop` is the **single, unified core loop** — both the streaming
//! and non-streaming entry points spawn the same loop body. To keep that body
//! reviewable, the per-iteration work is split into focused phase functions:
//!
//! ```text
//! prepare_turn  →  ┌─ run_compact ─→ run_think ─→ ┬─ run_tools (verifier-pass → finalize_completed_run)
//!                  │                              ├─ verify_final_text (verifier-pass → emit_final_text)
//!                  │                              └─ NoResponse → finalize_no_response
//!                  └─ (loop continues …)         max_iterations exhausted → finalize_max_iterations
//! ```
//!
//! Phase fns are `pub(crate) async fn` and all return `Result<…>`. The
//! `yield_event!` / `yield_final_event!` / `try_send!` macros from
//! `super::super::stream_macros` short-circuit the **enclosing function** with
//! `return Ok(())` when the receiver is closed, so phases must return
//! `Result<…>` for that "abandon stream" behavior to bubble up to the loop
//! driver — which then exits with `Ok(())`.
